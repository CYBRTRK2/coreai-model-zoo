# Build FunASRGate: xcodegen generate + xcodebuild Release, automatic signing (team MFN25KNUGJ, as DecideGate).
# Build only: no install, no launch.
#   ./_build.sh                  generic iOS                     -> _work/app_path.txt
#   ./_build.sh --mac            macOS (arm64)                   -> _work/app_path_mac.txt
#   ./_build.sh --mac --public   macOS, public kit API only      -> _work/app_path_mac_public.txt
# Every build but --public compiles all modules with ENABLE_TESTABILITY=YES: the gate reads the generated ids and the
# per-stage times through `@testable import CoreAIKit` (KitFunASRModel.transcribeWindows), as the kit's
# FunASRSmokeTests do. --public leaves testability off everywhere and builds the gate's text-and-wall-time path
# (FUNASR_PUBLIC_API): the control for what -enable-testing costs in the numbers.
# The kit comes by path (project.yml). A build that resolves packages can write the kit checkout's Package.resolved
# (memory: reference_xcodebuild_local_package_resolved): this script checks it before and after, and when the build
# changed a file that was clean before, it keeps the diff in _work/ and restores the file (git checkout).
# Derived data, package checkouts and logs: _work/ (git-ignored).
